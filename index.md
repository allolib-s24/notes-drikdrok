# Christian's Allolib S24 Notes

# MIDI 
I created a small synthesia-like app that will read live MIDI input from a keyboard and display "floating notes" from what was played. The file is:
* [MIDI_Notes](https://github.com/allolib-s24/notes-drikdrok/blob/main/MIDI_Notes.cpp)

I also wrote up a small tutorial on how to get live MIDI input which you can find [here](https://github.com/allolib-s24/notes-drikdrok/blob/main/MIDI_Tutorial.md) (pull request still up)
  
With this, I created 2 melodies. Both are from one of my favourite video games, *Heroes of Might and Magic 5*, composed by Paul Anthony Romero.

# Final Project - Theremin Synthesis
For my final project, I created an app that functioned as a theremin simulator, attempting to synthesize the iconic sound.
